<blockquote><a title="Daily Prompt: Menagerie | The Daily Post" href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/daily-prompt-menagerie/" target="_blank"><strong>Do you have animals in your life? If yes, what do they mean to you? If no, why have you opted not to?</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>My first pet as far as I remember was a puppy when I was 7 years old. It was a dog (I forget what breed), we named him Napoleon and my mother got really attached to him. One day I called his name and he was nowhere, it hit my mother harder that he went missing and we never got a pet again.</p>
<p>Technically we did have pets, chickens, mice, rabbit and when my mother's sister was moving their dogs, Sandy and Blackie (mother and son), stayed at our place. They stayed for a while; Sandy got pregnant (I think it was through incest with Blackie) and had 3 puppies. I adopted one in my mind but my aunt came to get them a while.</p>
<p>Years later, I grew to dislike pets especially dogs plus I got scared of them maybe because of my failed attachments. When I moved to Canada, the host family I first stayed with had 2 dogs and a cat (I forget all their names but one was called Blackie). I gradually warmed up to pets.</p>

<p>I've been wanting to get a puppy for a while specifically a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_(dog)" target="_blank">Maltese</a> or <a class="zem_slink" title="Pekingese" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekingese" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Pekingese</a>. A couple of friends have threaten to stay away from my house if I do get one.  The topic did not specify if the animals had to be real so let me introduce you to Dwigy who is technically a dog and one of my many plush animals.</p>

<p>I got Dwigy in December 2010. He spends a lot of time on my bed and he's one of my confidant (yes! I talk to him, <a title="Believe" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/impossibility/" target="_blank">read here for more clarification: #2</a>). I cuddle him when I'm about to go to sleep. Other times, he's on my bookshelf hanging out with the rest of the gang.</p>
