<p>I was going to write this last week Friday. Motivation Monday seemed a better time for it</p>
<p>My choice of university is questionable but I had the best defense; a stepping stone to that degree that required 2 years of undergraduate. I never applied for that degree instead I wanted some other focus which I didn't get.</p>
<p>While my brother was driving me to my convocation, I started a long rant of things that shouldn't have and I ended on the year I regret the most, my second year. What does it matter anymore? I am done with this chapter so why do I still have that regret?</p>
<p>One question I kept getting at the ceremony that I hated the most was : <em> So what are you doing next?</em> and variants of such question. Why don't we ever live in the moment? We spend our lives constantly waiting for the next thing that we don't appreciate the present until it has passed and we are reminiscing on the <em>good old days</em>.</p>

<p>I had made a mess of some of my first few months in university. Motivated by the fear of failing, I couldn't rest till I was assured of at least ending up on the Dean's list every year. I pushed myself to take on more extracurricular activities. Over 2 years ago, I pondered on my life and realized what a waste it was going to be if I finished school with no work experience related to my field. I am glad I pushed myself more and I am where I am right now.</p>
<p>I am still afraid, scared and shy. I am scared of what the future holds. I am afraid of societal pressure to get married and have kids. I am scared I grew up too fast and lost the kid within. I am scared I will never be fully independent. I do not have everything figured out and I tell myself this - where I am right now - is a start so I should worry less. I am so scared of <del>not getting into</del> grad school that I'm not sure I'll apply still,  I started working on my application several months ago.</p>
<p>I console myself that if all else fails or I can no longer handle the immerse pressure  I put on myself, I should have my South America funds secure so I can drop off the radar and move there to try live worry free.</p>

<p>I was asked on Sunday to advice younger peeps and I couldn't say anything other than thank my parents till tears were in my eyes. I told myself later that  I should have said "Started from the bottom....now we here so don't give up" but I hate that line. My real advice is <strong>embrace your fears, let it guide and motivate you but never let it control you because what you achieve shapes you</strong>.</p>
<p>Always and forever scared,</p>
