<p>I am being to think that the likelihood of me  cook is more frequent when I'm craving a particular food badly. The last time was <a title="Baked Malfada Corta and Cheese" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2013/04/16/pasta-and-cheese/" target="_blank">Pasta and Cheese</a> and I still have leftovers in the fridge.</p>
<p>I was on Skype with my brother talking about how hungry I was and he told me to go cook. I didn't have much groceries to make a tangible meal so I was planning on going out to buy ready-to-eat food. He teased me about being lazy so I decided I was going to cook. That was when I started craving spanish rice.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a title="All Recipes | Spanish Rice" href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-spanish-rice/?scale=3&amp;ismetric=0" target="_blank">this spanish rice</a> and <a title="All Recipes | Irish Steak" href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/irish-steaks/detail.aspx?scale=2&amp;ismetric=0" target="_blank">this steak</a> recipes from my favourite recipe website.</p>
<p>CHANGES MADE</p>
<p>Spanish Rice: I did not follow serving and I added crushed chillies and cayenne pepper</p>

<p>Steak: I was too lazy to go to LCBO for whiskey so I used red wine (Barefoot Shiraz) and I didn't use fresh Parsley.</p>

<p>VERDIT<br />
Love it. The rice wasn't as soft as I wanted it to be and next time I'll try it with a different wine.<br />
