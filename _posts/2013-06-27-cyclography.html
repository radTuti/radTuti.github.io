<p>I recently just got my hand on the <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/map/index.htm" target="_blank">Toronto Cycling Map</a> for 2013. So I am looking through at in and in the Downtown Core Map, I noticed yellow highlighting on certain paths with the legend stating <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/routes/2805101">Downtown Explorer Route</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Downtown Toronto Cycling Map by Tuti A'mare, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/93120024@N07/9146823745/"><img alt="Downtown Toronto Cycling Map" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7421/9146823745_12902984da_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Been living downtown for a few months now, I've gotten bored of my usual routine and I am hoping to start new ones. Looking at the map got me thinking, what if I could bike around the city using the map and capture some pictures along the way? <!--nextpage-->So how is this beneficial to me?</p>
<ol>
<li>Physical: I get to clock in more hours of physical activity so I don't feel guilty about not doing yoga in the morning or going to the gym in the evening or not signing up for bootcamp classes.</li>
<li>Mental: I get to explore new place and see Toronto different, I call this <em>cyclography </em>[<del>my word</del> <em>Update: initially thought i coined the word</em>]. While exploring the city, I am hoping to learn about the different neighbourhoods and history this city has to offer.</li>
<li>Blog: I get to share my journey through the with the amazing people that read my blog (you!)</li>
<li>Skills: I get to improve my photography skills because I plan to shoot mainly in manual mode. I also want to improve my time spent biking.</li>
<li>I get to <a title="#Unplug | Fact Company" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/section/unplug" target="_blank">#unplug</a> (click link for more details) <strong>...and many more</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I am planning on starting this next week. In each post, I will state what route I took and also where pictures are taken. I had been musing over this idea since Tuesday but I finally got inspired by this video to post it on here.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can inspire someone through this project to explore &amp; see Toronto (or any city) differently!</p>
