<p>My last post was around Thanksgiving. There is quite a bit that has happened since then. In no specific order:</p>
<ul>
<li>I watched 2 movies; <a class="zem_slink" title="The Butler" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327773/" target="_blank" rel="imdb">The Butler</a> and <a title="Gravity" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/" target="_blank">Gravity</a>. Those were heart moving movies and I almost cried while watching the butler; there can never be enough movies to explain all the troubles colored people went through. Which reminds me about the trailer for Monument Men I saw while waiting for Gravity to start; there's never enough movies to explain the Nazi regime. I do not know if I appreciate Gravity more because I had no idea what it was about, or because <a class="zem_slink" title="George Clooney" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/" target="_blank" rel="imdb">George Clooney</a> (huge crush alert!) was in it or because it was an amazing story line; I think all of the above.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://tugraphos.tumblr.com/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/6df8d326384bf46ca936a4b12d7ccf95/tumblr_mv7cx1JFkG1sd89jxo1_500.jpg" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>I went to watch my first football game at the <a class="zem_slink" title="Rogers Centre" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.6413888889,-79.3891666667&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=43.6413888889,-79.3891666667 (Rogers%20Centre)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Rogers Centre</a> and it was amazing. The <a class="zem_slink" title="Toronto Argonauts" href="http://www.argonauts.ca/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Toronto Argos</a> played very well plus it was a Pink event (raising awareness of all women cancers). The Rogers Centre is also home to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Toronto Blue Jays" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Toronto Blue Jays</a> which is our baseball team. During the 3rd quarter when I went to get my free refill, I saw the mini hat (pic above) and made my friend buy me ice-cream just so i could get the Blue Jays hat-like bowl/cup.</li>
<li>Work had been going on great; sometimes busy but I love it. I get to learn so much and not to brag but I have amazing co-workers. There's this thing at work where we call someone the latest wrongly written (auto correct included) or pronounced version of their name. I am trying to make myself an exception because with a name like 'Tofunmi', Tofu isn't so far off and I hoped I was done with being called that in high school. So I'm using Liam Neeson's Taken like "[If you call me Tofu] ... I'll find you and I'll kill you".</li>
<li>I've got a Halloween party to go for and I've spent the past weeks trying to figure out what to go as. A friend suggested Lady Godiva as a joke and I'm really biased towards being a superhero (I was hoping for Ironman and I currently can't pull off being Rogue). I've never really taken part in Halloween because I feel I should know better considering the history but then I really want to have an experience of Halloween; I am almost torn. This remind of daily lives of Christians when we sin even when we know shouldn't; good griefs we have an amazing Father.</li>
<li>I went to a<a title="My love for Monae" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/my-love-for-monae/" target="_blank"> Janelle Monae concert</a> this past weekend; it was awesome! I was a bit sad that I got there late because I was going around talking about getting there super early so I can stand in-front and breathe the air coming out of her nostrils. I was still close to the front just not close enough; I didn't even get to touch her when we was crowd-surfing. She is an amazing artist and a dramatic performer. LONG LIVE ANDROIDS<strong>*</strong></li>
<li>I've not been taking pictures as much as I told myself to :( Speaking on photography,Â I'm volunteering for this amazing group (<a title="Chase Toronto" href="http://chasetoronto.org/" target="_blank">Chase Toronto</a>). Most nights I moonlight as a website developer and I have lots of changes to make to the site but that's going steadily. If you do have a comment about changes i could make, let me know (Pls be my unpaid testers and check for 'bugs').</li>
<li>I am back on BBM. I can complain about Blackberry to the moon but deep down I still love them plus it's a Canadian company so I can't hate. I think BBM trumps WhatsApp and iMessage (let's not even mention the limitations of SMS/MMS). Getting BBM reminds me of what I don't like so much: I connect with an old friend, we chat a lot during the first few moments after the connection has been made after which they just because a name on my list. It remind me on how much I suck at close communications which is weird cause I claim to be great with social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm done writing. Till next time...</p>
