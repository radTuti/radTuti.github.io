<p><a href="http://www.bumblesandlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PoeticWinterIntro.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74" title="PoeticWinterIntro" src="http://alldayrandom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/poeticwinterintro.jpg" alt="" width="783" height="524" /></a></p>
<p>Ignore the drug the title brings to mind. No drug? Then ignore this line</p>
<p>In lieu of randomness, I decided to have a section where I share one random picture a day(weekends optional). This is going to be a challenge because I've lost the urge to take random pictures (I think).</p>
<p>Now, I would state my qualification, amateur enthusiastic picture taker. There you have it, maybe as I progress, I would get better, who knows? But the amateur is a lifelong thing. The main camera would be a <em>Fujifilm FinePix</em> S1800(on loan from a friend),<em> </em>others could include my Blackberry9800 or a friend's phone. I will try to mention what I use every time.</p>
<p>So I'm looking pictures online to attach to this post and I come across <a title="Poetic Winter, A Photography Challenge | Bumbles &amp; Light" href="http://www.bumblesandlight.com/2012/01/poetic-winter-a-photography-challenge/" target="_blank">this</a> which is where I got my cover picture from. What is better than photos? Poems/ Quotes written on the pictures.</p>
<p>No! I am not going to write any poem or line on my pictures (maybe along the line).</p>
<p>Apart from the attached picture, any picture in the challenge would be mine and should not be used without permission and acknowledgement. Those are my simple terms &amp; conditions subject to further revision.</p>
