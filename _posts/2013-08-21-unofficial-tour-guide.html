<h2>Six Months Ago.</h2>
<p>It had been a while since she last went on Twitter online. Navigating through her page, she noticed an increase in her followers so she went to Interactions to check who her new followers were.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dare Goke followed you</p></blockquote>
<p>Squinting at the tiny avatar showing, she tried to make out the picture. The words left her mouth before she remembered she was in the library's quiet zone "Dare? Is this the same Dare Goke I grew up in the same neighborhood with?". She looked around the room and was met by "evil eyes" from the people who were now distracted from their reading by her voice.</p>
<p>Looking back at her computer she clicks on this avatar, leading to his profile. Clicking on the follow button, she proceeds to send him a Direct Message</p>
<blockquote><p><em>hi stranger. fancy finding you here</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>She had hoped to receive a reply instantly considering his last tweet was just a min ago. Disappointed, she exited Twitter on her laptop and went back to her research paper. Her topic was Ethical Issues in My Sister's Keeper which she had randomly picked but was now too lazy to watch the movie or read the book. Here she was at the library hoping to fill the paper with enough ethical jargon using few examples of what she read from Wikipedia. She isn't here to be distracted by Dare, her one time neighbor, crush, friend, best friend, lover...</p>

<h2>Present Day.</h2>
<p>Her phone is ringing... Not recognizing the number, she contemplates letting it ring out but then changes her mind.</p>
<p>"Hello" she says with the stern yet soft voice she gives to strangers "Who's this?"</p>
<p>Nobody replied. She could hear someone laughing which made her slightly irritated. "Zee?! Is it me you are giving your stranger hello voice to...it has been a while, don't you think?"</p>
<p>Very few people called her Zee. Actually nobody called her Zee anymore...well one person did at one time.</p>
<p>"DARE GOKE...omg! I'm so sorry. It has been a while"</p>
<p>You cannot blame her for not recognizing his voice. Last time she spoke to him, he was in that transitional phase between a boy and a man. This voice was manly and confident, she tried to picture the boy she grew up with as a man. How time flies?</p>
<p>The phone call didn't last long because she was at work. The main highlights from their conversation was that he is in her town and she is going to be his <em>unofficial tour guide</em>.</p>
