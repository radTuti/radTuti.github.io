<p>A girl shared a little bit of her story about how she got physically assaulted. Looking at her, I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to tell her sorry because it wasn't my fault and I doubt if that would have helped. This got me thinking that we may not be able to look at her the same way again.</p>
<p>Recently, there's been hassles about girls getting assaulted based on the way they dressed. But this girl was a jewish looking girl so explain to me why she was assaulted! I can't explain how it is related to the quote without divulging details so I digress.</p>
