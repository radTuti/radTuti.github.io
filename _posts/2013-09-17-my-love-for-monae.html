<p>In case you don't know, I'm referring to <a class="zem_slink" title="Janelle Monáe" href="http://www.jmonae.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Janelle Monáe</a>; I am a huge fan and she's one of my girl crushes. Here's 5 reasons why I love her, in no specific order:</p>
<h2>1. She introduced me to <a class="zem_slink" title="Fun (band)" href="http://www.ournameisfun.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">fun.</a></h2>
<p>I only listened to fun.'s "<a class="zem_slink" title="Fun.: We Are Young ft. Janelle Monáe [OFFICIAL VIDEO]" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts" target="_blank" rel="youtube">We Are Young</a>" because Janelle was featuring. I was able to discover fun. and I love them separately for the artists they are.</p>
<h2>2. She show how amazing uniformity can be</h2>
<p>She wear black and white almost all the time (I say almost because there are pictures of her in colors). Regardless of how often she wears b&amp;w there almost always a spin or twist to it.</p>

<h2>3. She's weird and a rebel</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Have you heard her music?</h2>

<p>Mind-blowing right?</p>
<h2>5. Cyborgs, Andriods (not the software)... need  I say more?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got tickets to watch her perform next month and I so cannot wait!</p>
