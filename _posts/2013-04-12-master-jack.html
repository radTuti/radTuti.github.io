<blockquote>When I grow up, I want to be a <a title="…Of All Trades" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/polymath/" target="_blank">polymath</a> like Jack</p>
<p>"Jack who?" you ask</p>
<p>I reply "Jack...you know? Jack of all trades!"</p>
<p>"How is that possible?" you say</p></blockquote>
<p>...being skilled in as many ____ as possible! <del>Before I continue, I am about to nerd out on you. Understand?</del> Moving on...</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://alldayrandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130412-105852.jpg"><img class="size-full aligncenter" alt="" src="http://alldayrandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130412-105852.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>I studied <del>this major that is somewhat strange to most people</del> <a class="zem_slink" title="Health informatics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_informatics" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Health Informatics</a> in university and as I like to dumb it down to a meaning <del>I take offense in</del>, it is about IT in health care. No! I don't work with the equipment like MRI and whatever else they have. I'm more involved in the software aspect.</p>
<p><del>I must confess and say I somewhat stumbled into it.</del> I was learning about database (mainly front end) and that fueled my desire to learn <a class="zem_slink" title="MySQL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">MySQL</a> which I self-taught myself the basics over one summer. It helped that I interned as a database administrator assistant and I later found out I had to take a class on it. I was helping out in maintaining a website for a group when I was <del>wrongly</del> told that I needed Java to fix it up [it was <a class="zem_slink" title="JavaScript" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">JavaScript</a> the person meant].</p>
<p>Anyways, I started looking for way to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>, it was seeming to hard for me to self-learn. I almost gave up when Eureka! the new curriculum for my major required a programming class, specifically Java! I signup and I must admit I went home after each class wanting to cry because I was too lazy to practice programming everyday. One weekend I gave myself a crash study session on all things beginners Java and since then Java has been my true love.</p>
<p>I skipped over taking an <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">HTML</a>/<a class="zem_slink" title="Cascading Style Sheets" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">CSS</a> class in my first year [or second] and I was loving it! I think last year, I got more interested in website design and development so I got a book on <a class="zem_slink" title="PHP" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">PHP</a>, MySQL, CSS, HTML, <a class="zem_slink" title="Ajax (programming)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">AJAX</a>. I knew I had gone off the programming rails when at a job interview I was asked "How many languages do you know?" I started listing programming languages with my levels of proficiency till I was corrected about it meaning <del>lay</del> language to which I responded "Oh...just English" :(</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQvE8xHrCDNo0ORJzXnC1TySwFRDr7eo8qzWKwuZmWgglmvHsczUQ" width="207" height="244" /></p>
<p>I am planning on improving the languages I speak (and write in) as I have plans to learn French<del>, Mandarin</del> and Spanish this busy summer. I was working for this group when I realized to make shit [pardon my language] more appealing to them, I needed to step up my game. What did I do? I got <a class="zem_slink" title="Adobe Creative Suite" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Adobe CS6</a> and I am currently learning my way through it. So far I have used Fireworks [ for app prototype], Photoshop [ I got to assist a friend in using it for her fancy resume], Illustrator[mainly posters] , InDesign [business card] and Dreamweaver.</p>
<p>Slightly back to the real world, my major has a health component and my plan for that is currently brewing [I would share if it wasn't a top secret classified information to be reveled after my masters]. My other interest include photography, adventures [I'm joining a lot o f Meetups to help plus skydiving this summer annyone?], <a title="Pretty Dames | For things we love" href="http://prettydames.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">fashion and style</a> [I may be slacking in this aspect] and many more which I might reveal in more details in the next installments <del>if I can make myself write one</del> of this post.</p>
<p>Finally some programming humor...</p>
