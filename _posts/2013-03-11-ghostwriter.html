<blockquote><a title="Daily Prompt: Ghost Writer | The Daily Post" href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/daily-prompt-ghostwriter/" target="_blank"><strong>If you could have any author –living or dead – write your biography, who would you choose?</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a really tough question. I am going through the huge list of books I've read so far and trying to weight which author is better poised to tell my story. Here is a list of runner- ups and the winnerwill be annouced at the end.</p>
<p>The Old Man and the Sea was the only <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Ernest Hemingway" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Ernest Hemingway</a></strong> book I read without understanding. I read it in high school when I was 13/14 years old. Why Hemingway then? I don't fully understand my life and  I still thought it was a good book even if  I didn't understand it.</p>
<p>I read most of <a title="William Shakespeare" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare" target="_blank"><strong>William Shakespeare</strong></a>'s plays when I was like 8/9 years old, my sister was reading it for her classes in high school. I loved the tragedies included in the plays. I like to think of my life as a tragedy with my never ending search for a meaning.</p>
<p>I did not read any of <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Jane Austen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Jane Austen</a></strong> books until last year summer when my friend and I did a Austen challenge and we read all her 6 major books. I like the way she writes and how she portrays the heroine plus it feels like she's conversing with me when I read it.</p>
<p>To Kill a Mockingbird is such an amazing book. I did not read this until summer last year either. My friend bought the book and I wanted to read it to understand what make it such a big deal. <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Harper Lee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_Lee" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Harper Lee</a></strong> is such a great writer and I now get why it is such a big deal.</p>
<p>When I read Twenties Girl by <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Sophie Kinsella" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Kinsella" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Sophie Kinsella</a></strong> in 2011 (<em>I think</em>) I felt like it was me. I was so intrigued by it and few weeks after I read it when I was starting a new blog for the umpteenth time, my url was inspired by the book. I love the playfulness in all her novels.</p>
<p>Others I thought about: <a title="James Patterson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Patterson" target="_blank"><strong>James Patterson</strong></a>, <strong><a title="John Grisham" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grisham" target="_blank">John Grisham</a></strong></p>
<p>*DRUM ROLL*</p>
<p>I choose <b>JANE AUSTEN</b>!!! Again, I cannot say how amazing I think her books plus I see myself as a heroine.</p>
