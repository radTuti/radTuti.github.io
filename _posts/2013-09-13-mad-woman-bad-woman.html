<p>Today is the first day in long time since I've been out. I don't know what day it is, judging from the weather I'll say it's between August and October. I think it's still 2013; while it feels like eternity, I know they won't lock me up for years. As I take in the fresh air, it feels coarse and I fear my lungs ability to perform. Last time I was out, the floors were white and nature was playing a trick on us with a sunny cold winter.</p>
<p>I've been living in this sanatorium since March; that I can remember to the failure of my doctors. They have all tried to make me forget or tell me to forget even if they never would. I see it in my mother's eyes when she comes to see me. I know I have failed everyone but her I failed the most which is why I've refused to see anyone but my mother. I wish I could make things right by her.</p>
<p>I want to say what happens but I am afraid of the details. I keep a journal which no one knows of and every time I write about that day, the details always change. Even the dreams I have are different although they always start and end the same. Do not tell about my dream, it's my private world; in it I do a better job at saving her but she still dies.</p>
<p>When Nadia barged into my room to tell me Dee was on the roof and threatening to jump, I laughed. Why would Nadia talk about it? Dee is like the boy who cries wolf and everyone is scared of the one time the wolf will eat him. Not completely willing, I got up and made my way to the roof.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>I have this rule which is "If someone really want to commit suicide, they will just do". No one needs the constant threat of suicide with no action being taken. I subscribe to school of "If you want to do it, do it. I adopted this principle when I considered suicide and I realized I didn't want to die, I wanted someone to notice and care plus this is my way of denying I ever considered suicide.</p>
<p>"Dee, are you kidding me?! Not this again... if you really want to jump then jump..." I turned around to my friends chastising me for what I just said. I started to defend myself and only stopped when my friends ran towards and past me to Dee. Turning around to where Dee was standing, I couldn't see Dee again. <em>Where is she? </em>I figured she came to her senses and got down when Nadia started crying.</p>
<p>Dee had jumped and the last thing anybody ever said to her was she should jump. It is my fault! How will i not withdraw from society? I hear Dee and all the others blaming me for their death. If only I had tried better to stop her, I'm a bad person and they want me to forget about it. I cannot, I refuse to, I will take it to my grave even if that means I stay mad.</p>
<p>The voices have started again, "I am sorry" I scream but they ignore me and taunt me. A lady is white comes towards me and I find myself slipping...slipping out...out of consciousness. I am falling and no one can save me...</p>
