<p><a title="Daily Prompt: VIP | The Daily Post" href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/daily-prompt-vip/" target="_blank"><strong>Who’s the most important person in your life — and how would your day-to-day existence be different without them?</strong></a></p>
<hr />
<p>I really don't have one person that is the most important person (VIP) in my life right now. I watched a <a class="zem_slink" title="Short film" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">short film</a> several weeks ago and I have to say regardless of who my VIP is, this would be how my daily life will be without them in it. Also I like to think that my VIP would be my future husband<del> (<em>should I get married</em>)</del></p>
