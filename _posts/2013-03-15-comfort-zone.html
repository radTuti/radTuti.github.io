<blockquote><strong><a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/daily-prompt-comfort/">What are you more comfortable with â€” routine and planning, or laissez-faire spontaneity? </a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Shek</strong>:<em>Tuti, you need to constant check your calendar...when someone ask you about a date, you should say "Wait! I'll check my calendar and let you know"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tami</strong>:<em>Hey! I've got this event...wanna come?</em></p>
<p>Me: Uhm...sure, sign me up</p>
<p>[<em>checks calendar</em>]</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Hey Tami, I can't make it :( I've got something else that day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DJ</strong>: <em>I know you're busy Tuti with all your stuff but can we just take this moment...</em></p>
<p><strong>Elle</strong>: Don't tell me you can't make it again</p>

<p>Those are just excerpts from different moments of my life.</p>
<p>I recall being younger and being mocked for carrying a planner; I thought it was fancy even though I had nothing to put in it.</p>
<p>Two years ago, a planner became a daily fixture in my life with my different involvements and all that jazz.</p>
<p>I want to be spontaneous...wake up one day and take that 3.5 days train ride from Toronto to Vancouver (money be damned). But I have work, I have a life plan, albeit not complete but it's getting there.</p>
<p><em>Maybe if I hit jackpot, I'll become spontaneous again...or like I learnt in Econ classes, "all things being equal..."</em></p>
