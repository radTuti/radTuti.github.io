<blockquote><em>Tuti I will be moving out next week, what day are you free for us to go out together"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I feel a lump in my throat, my chest is tightening, the past five years flash before my eyes and my eyes start to water.</p>
<p>*blink*</p>
<p>I cannot stop this. I need to compose myself, this is not professional behavior.</p>
<p>*breathe*</p>
<p>This is my "<em>best friend</em>" whom I have grown distant with over the past year or so. She tried to reach out, I've tried less and thought about giving up.</p>
<p>*blink*</p>
<p>When I have anything to discuss or need advice, I still turned to her and she gave me.</p>
<p>*breathe*</p>
<blockquote><p>:( I've got work rest of the week but I'm free weekend</p></blockquote>
<p>Moving to a foreign country alone was easier because we did it together. I though the only distance we would ever have will be the night we argued and I said you should never talk to me again then I forgot in the morning and called you.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ok maybe Sunday</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I will admit this now I think I got jealous and did not want to share you with anyone. So the distance was my fault even thought I blamed you. You may never read this but I am still sorry I never seem to make an effort.</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay. Sunday it is.</p></blockquote>
