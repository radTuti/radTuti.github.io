<p><strong>Another self-diagnosis</strong>: I'm perpetually depressed</p>
<p>I'm fairly happy with my life. I am actually in a good place right now.Â It is driving me insane.</p>

<p>I struggle with my identity and what I want to see myself as. I refuse to stick with one thing. I may be writing this today because of my graduation is tomorrow. I am officially going to be out of the education system for at least a year. What the future holds...who knows?</p>
<p>I'm deluded about how I am viewed by everyone other than me so I cannot say I care how people see me. Would that make a difference?</p>
<p>On the search for something to occupy me, I am rebooting my <a title="One a Day" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/photography-challenge/" target="_blank">photography challenge</a>; however, rather than post one picture a day, I will post seven pictures once a week. In addition, I recently found out about <a title="Processing.org" href="http://www.processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> so I will be doing that and trying to work on <a title="FluxAbstract" href="https://github.com/scottsullivan/FluxAbstract" target="_blank">this open-source project</a>.</p>
<p>What else? Work as usual, befriending park benches, meetups (hopefully!).</p>
<p>I do not want to be labeled. I like the unknown. This scares me shitless!</p>
<p>Do I want to know who I am?</p>
