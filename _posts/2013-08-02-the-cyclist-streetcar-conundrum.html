<p>I got into an accident yesterday on my way to meet up with someone at the Starbucks near <a class="zem_slink" title="St. George (TTC)" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.6682638889,-79.3998888889&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=43.6682638889,-79.3998888889 (St.%20George%20%28TTC%29)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">St. George Station</a>. I was using Google Maps on my iPhone as my GPS to find the fastest route so I won't be late. The accident happened while I was on Dundas Street W. trying to enter Beatrice St.</p>
<p>To say the truth, most of it is somewhat of a blur. All I remember is I was turning and next thing i knew I was being throw over the handlebars to oncoming traffic. First thing I did was to try to save my face as I thrust my hand forward to try and land on my palms. I got up almost immediately with people around asking me if I was okay. I was feeling disoriented with a little motion sickness; my first instinct was to pick my bike up and keep going. A woman [<em>I think she was going for a walk with her baby</em>] approached me and helped me move to the sidewalk from the road.</p>
<p>She encourage me to seat on the floor and take a breather but I told her I was fine. However, I found out that the accident caused my front brakes to lock on the wheel so I couldn't keep biking. Not too far ahead was a couple outside their house that helped me with the brakes [<em>turns out they weren't too sure what they were doing, they were just trying to help :)</em>]. They offered me a glass of water and talked about how they had been victims to the streetcar tracks.</p>

<p>I think I sprained my  right hand wrist and left knee feels really tender and cannot complete their full motion. I was scared I may have a concussion but I think wearing a bike helmet helped except my vision gets blurry sometimes. My neck is sore and turn my head hurts; this affect my vocal cords and makes turning my head hurt. I had a hard time falling asleep last night which probably would have been worse if I didn't take Tylenol before bed.</p>
<p>I want to thank the woman with her baby and the couple that helped me. You guys made me feel so much better and confident enough to not quit cycling. I would like to apologize to the two guys that tried to talk to me [<em>it was obvious they had no idea what I had just been through</em>] and I brushed off; I wasn't in the mood because i was still trying to recover. Finally I want to thank the cars on the opposing traffic for being defensive observant drivers and stopping till I got off the road.</p>
<p>The general rule is to cross streetcar tracks at 90 degree angles. I want to point out this isn't my first time making a left turn over streetcar tracks and that might explain why this was a shocker to me. Suffice to say, I got lucky! I'm taking my bicycle for repairs this weekend and hopefully I am back to riding by Monday.</p>
