<p>I was at the <a title="Royal Ontario Museum" href="http://www.rom.on.ca/en" target="_blank">ROM </a>this past Sunday for the very first time. I've always admired the building (which I learnt is actually 3 buildings) and I've gone f0r a talk with one of their top photographer but this past Sunday, I went it. I took a tour of the <em>great pieces</em> in the museum. The penultimate piece the group was shown was an amethyst geode cut out for us to see the amethyst. Interestingly, our guide told us a folklore of how the purple quartz was formed.</p>
<p>Amethyst was a young virgin who became the object of wrath of the Greek God Dionysus after he became intoxicated. The Goddess Diana  helped immediately turned the girl into a white, shimmering stone (quartz). When Dionysus realized what had happened and felt remorse for his actions, his tears dripped into his goblet of wine. The goblet overturned, and the wine spilled all over the white rock, saturating it until it became the purple quartz that is now known as Amethyst.</p>
<p>Amethyst is the birthstone for those born in the month of February; if months were persons I can picture February as a young virgin who died before her time. It seems like it was just yesterday that 2014 started and the month is almost over. I am glad that I on track with most of my plans and resolutions and I've got so much to look forward to this year! I am almost done with my <a title="Lift Quantified Diet" href="https://lift.do/quantified-diet" target="_blank">Paleo diet</a> and while it was a bit challenging, I thought it would be nice to have monthly challenges.</p>
<p>February is my creativity kick starting month and I aim to do all of the 29 Ways to stay creative (see video below). I realize that there are only 28 days in the year so I plan to cross off one or more of the 29 ways each day and hopefully increase how many I do daily.</p>
