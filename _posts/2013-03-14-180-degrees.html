<blockquote><a title="Daily Prompt: 180 | The Daily Post" href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/daily-prompt-180/" target="_blank"><strong>Tell us about a time you did a 180 — changed your views on something, reversed a decision, or acted in a way you ordinarily don’t.</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>This a story about Tuti and Bellamy*.</p>
<p>[<em>Warning: I talk about myself in the third person</em>]</p>
<p>You've met Tuti, now meet Bellamy. They met through a mutual volunteer program.</p>
<p>Some how both caught each other's radar.  Tuti taunts Bellamy about a signature of his.</p>
<p>Tuti notices Bellamy is pretty hot. Tuti shuts that emotion and still taunts Bellamy.</p>
<p>Bellamy wants to talk to Tuti about somethings so they fix a date. At Tuti's apartment.</p>
<p>Tuti flirts with Bellamy. The <em>date</em> occurs. Tuti and Bellamy shared some kisses.</p>
<p>...<i>several weeks later</i>...</p>
<p>Tuti: Hi Bellamy!</p>
<p>Bellamy: Hey! How are you?</p>
<p>T: Good. I'm planning on watching a movie on Saturday. Wanna go together?</p>
<p>T: We could get dinner before we watch the movie.</p>
<p>B: Are you asking me out?</p>
<p>T: Uhm... I don't know... Somewhat</p>
<p>B: Okay. I have work and hockey so maybe after if it's not too late</p>
<hr />
<p>The first time I asked a guy out, somewhat. It felt very weird and that was one time I beat myself up for every message I sent. Every fiber in my body seemed to be struggling to rejecting the process.</p>
<p>Safe to say, the dinner/ movie date never happened. I don't plan on asking a guy out again anytime soon.</p>
<p>*Name changed</p>
