<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42" title="Outdoor Marriage" src="http://alldayrandom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/423935_502962613065363_135678799_n.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>Admire that view in the picture* above.  I particularly love how the picture captures more of the sky and water barrier like the wedding photobombed the picture. A perfect day for what is meant to be the best day of their lives. I imagine if I get married, that is a perfect wedding; nature, simple, just close friends and family.</p>
<p>Moving on to games...</p>
<p>Smurfs village is a very addictive game. The worse part about it is, to advance levels faster, one has to purchase smurfberries with  real money. Did you know there's a Smurfs village in Italy? It's a town called <strong>Júzcar</strong> in the province of Málaga, Southern Italy.</p>
<p>Another addictive game is Cut the Rope, On Nom Nom is so adorable. I feel bad when he doesn't get the candy.</p>
