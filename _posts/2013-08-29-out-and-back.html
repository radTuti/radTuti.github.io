<p>It feels like summer is already over, at least for me. I have beenÂ <em>forcing</em> myself to wear transitional pieces (i.e. a sweater or cardigan every time) and while it's still relatively hot, the air is getting cold. I got a new phone two weeks back after my last set of bicycle accidents left my phone screen shattered :(</p>
<p>I was in Hamilton last weekend to see my family; I went to Canada's Wonderland for a brother-sister time which was so much fun, I left with a headache. This Tuesday, I went for a photography meetup at The Ex and regardless of the rain managed to take a few good pictures. On thursday, I went for a fashion event</p>
