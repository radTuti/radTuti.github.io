<p>Today is my wedding day. I am not your typical bride and I am still unsure about the wedding/marriage.</p>
<p>This is an arranged marriage.</p>
<p>Now depending on who you are and what part of the world you originate from, my previous statement may have shocked you. Yes! It is 2013 and yes there are still arranged marriages. I may attempt to take a modernist approach and say I asked my parent to arrange my marriage. I did not. I could tell you that it is not technically arranged since I have known soon to be husband - calling him my husband feels weird so I'll stick with his name, Samuel - since I was a kid.</p>
<p>Samuel's family and my family have been friends for the longest time. When we were younger, our families will joke about Sam and I as husband and wife. Everyone took it as a joke till three months ago.</p>
<p>Sam's family moved out of the neighborhood when I was nine. His father got a new government job in a different province. They kept the house in my neighborhood, leasing it out and only every came back twice in the past 15 years; first when Sam's grandmother died seven years ago and last year when Sam's dad retired.</p>
<p>So far I have omitted something which is that Sam and I stayed friends. He once spend his holidays with my family and I traveled with them on one of their numerous boat cruises in Europe. If we stay friends why did Sam not propose to me? why have the marriage arranged? I asked him that and here's what he said with paraphrasing by me.</p>
<p>He does not love me but he is willing to try. He is at a point in his life where he feels he should settle down with a wife and have kids in the next five years. He considered his past relationships and figured out what he wanted in his future wife; a girl who his family like and he could be friends with. He thought about me and spoke to his parents who spoke to my parents, three months down the line and here we are.</p>
<p>Another thing I omitted is I had no intentions of ever getting married. Now, I could ask you to wish me luck in my marriage but I am marrying Sam who is first a friend to me.</p>
<hr />
<p>Please bear with me at my <del>poor</del> attempt to capture the idea of arranged marriages; there was a lot more I wanted to express but skipped. This is also submitted to the <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/07/18/daily-post-transition/" target="_blank">Daily Prompt</a>. I've always thought arranged marriages impede on free will and now I really don't have an opinion again because of the perspective I've tried to show through my character.</p>
