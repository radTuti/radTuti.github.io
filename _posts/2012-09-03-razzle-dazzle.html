<p>I think I get where Feminist are coming from. The idea that the world should stop being patriarchal and start seeing women as people.</p>
<p>The only problem is the ideology largely perpetuated is by radicals. The notion that women are equal to men and a feminist that marries a dude is a hypocrite. Plu-ease!</p>
<p>Where do I agree? Obviously women are actually people. Would a dude in his right mind want to really get intimate with anything other than a person? Duh!</p>
<p>I do not like the idea of a woman naked to get really sexy but a guy? oh no! why should he? He just needs to stay in his shorts and show his abs as distraction.</p>
<p>No! I don't really want to see his privates. I just don't want the girl to have to show hers.</p>
<p>NO! I am not a feminist!</p>
<p>Seriously though, I think it is pretty obvious that women are people and they need to be recognized. That is not rocket science!</p>
