<p>One reason why my blogging pace has be almost nonexistent is because I've been spending way too much time on <a title="Tuti | Medium" href="https://medium.com/@radTuti" target="_blank">Medium</a>. Today I stumbled on a post on <a title="What it means to go on a Living Spree - People musings. | Medium" href="https://medium.com/people-musings/661c6d8e96c6" target="_blank">what it means to go on a living spree</a>Â and I couldn't help but reflect on my life.</p>
<p>I got a call from my landlord's agent about if I wanted to renew my lease; I am glad I do not have to stress out about getting a new place. It's a year long lease and I considering if I should renew it for longer which is a good thing but at the back of my mind I can feel the pain from the cracks in my plans as I contemplate my lease. I was meant to have applied to grad school but I didn't because I scared. I am scared of not getting in, I am scared of choosing the wrong program. I am scared of making the wrong mistake.</p>
