<p>Before mother would bring up going to the Goke's house, I had suggested it many times. Today, she seemed particularly surprised that I hadn't mentioned going there in a while. Thinking it had to do with the many times she'd declined me, she generously gave me her permission to go visit. Mother was much surprised and a little angry when I declined.</p>
<p><em>I never want to hear about that family again!</em></p>
<p>A few weeks back, one of the older boys in the Goke family, Dan, came over to our house. I was in the study curled like a ball with a book in my hand. I believe it was an Enid Blyton book because I stopped reading them shortly after the incident. The other kids were outside playing and they aren't always accommodating of me joining them.</p>
<p>Dan came up to play with me or rather keep me company. I was happy that an older person thought highly of me to spent time with me. Everyday after that day, I've wished he never came over or  decided to keep me company. I've questioned myself after that day and blamed myself for everything. I decided to be more strict and less approving on anything and anyone in my life.</p>
