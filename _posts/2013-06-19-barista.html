<p>Today was his third day here and even though he kept denying it, he kept coming back because of her. This wasn't his third time at the coffee shop but three days ago when he saw her, he knew he was going to keep coming back. Why? That what he still can't figure out.</p>
<p>The first day.</p>
<p>She spoke to him but only when he was leaving. The thing was he has ignored her without realizing. As he walked to the cashier picking up a bottle of juice absentminded and armed with his Passbook app open he heard her say the words.</p>
<p>"You have finally decided to come to me...are you just getting a juice"</p>
<p>He suddenly forgot what he was worried about and looked up. With a short laugh he replied smiling "I didn't mean to. I already had a coffee and I am leaving. A bottle of juice is all I need to get me home". She scanned his phone but said nothing else so he added "Maybe next time, I will get more than just juice. Have a good night"</p>
<p><!--nextpage-->The second day.</p>
<p>He barely saw her but then it wasn't her fault. She couldn't have know that when he said next time, he actually meant the next day. He tried his best to leave work earlier hoping that if he got there the same time as yesterday, he might see her. Disappointed, he  got his book out and started reading.</p>
<p>While taking a break to drink his Refresher, he saw her in front of him. She was taking a break and eating with a friend. He can only assume that guy was just a friend, he needed to stay optimistic. He would wait till she was by the cashier stand to order his regular (a grande latte with a bread) and then maybe he could ask for her number.</p>
<p>She never went to the cashier. Instead she stayed at the back doing heavens knows what. This made his sad but the bright part was he made great strides in the books he was reading. While he read the books halfheartedly, he made a plan for the next day. He will be victorious tomorrow.</p>
<p><!--nextpage-->The third day/ Today.</p>
<p>The moment he came in, he regretted it. She was nowhere in sight and the usual <i>familiar</i> staff wasn't then. He hopes and plans to see her today has been dashed. Deep down there was still hope that she might be working so he got his usual, found a spot and started reading his book.</p>
<p>"Excuse me...do you mind if I share this table with you" the tiny child-like voice asked.</p>
<p>He knew it wasn't her, that wasn't her voice, not the way he remembered it. She has a soft voice that was very fitting of her. As he looked up he noticed that this voice underestimated its owner; pretty face dark-skinned girl like a Nubian queen.</p>
<p>"We can share" he said. Her eyes lit up as she sat down and brought out her laptop. The university wasn't too far off so he asked "Assignments?"</p>
<p>"No" pretty face said. "Research. I work at the hospital across the street"</p>
<p>"Doctor? Nurse? What?" As he struggled to remember all the health care profession, all that he could think of was Grey's Anatomy.</p>
<p>"Doctor. Anesthesiologist"</p>
<p>They talked so more before return to their reason for being at the coffee shop. Nubian queen was waiting for a friend who came 10 minutes later. When she was leaving, she thanked him and said goodbye.</p>
<p>He felt bad, he hadn't asked for her name because he was still thinking about the barista. As he adjusted his things on the table, a card fell to the floor, she left him her card.</p>
<p>His face warmed up as a smile overtook it; he had met his Nubian queen and this was all thanks to the barista. He would call her tonight. He couldn't wait!</p>
