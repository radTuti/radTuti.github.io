<p>"Sorry...my overly-friendly Labrador... he's distracted by the pretty girl" He said</p>
<p>I looked up and smiled "What's his name?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Rio"</p>
<p>In my mind I tried to figure out how to play with Rio and still hold my bicycle.Â The elevator was still not here and I couldn't think of what to say to him. I liked to try and carry a conversation with strangers; my mini-revolt for being an introvert.</p>
<p>"I should take my bike from my balcony and start biking" The elevator came just as he said that. I let him and Rio go ahead first.</p>
<p>"So what do you do? Take the transit instead" I asked as I adjusted my bike in the elevator.</p>
<p>"I work a few minutes away from here..." I didn't let him finish before I said "So you walk to work? It will take me half an hour to get to work if I walked"</p>
<p>He asked where I worked and talked about biking route. I wished I lived on a higher floor so we could talk some more and longer.</p>
<p>The chime in the elevator indicated it was on Floor 2 and Rio started heading out but he called for Rio while I wished nobody would get in. Nobody did.</p>

<p>Ground floor.</p>
<p>I smiled and greeted the concierge guy that always smiled at me and opened the door for me as I was coming in or heading out.</p>
<p>"Enjoy your ride" he said.</p>
<p>As I started pedaling away, it occurred to me that I never asked for his name or where he worked. He didn't ask for my name but I knew I wanted to talk to him again.</p>
<p>What do I know about him?</p>
<p>He looked striking [<em>normally I say cute rather than striking</em>]. He has an overly-friendly Labrador named Rio. He stays on my floor.His workplace is not far from the building.</p>
<p>There was a smile on my face during the bike ride as I though of endless possibilities... hopefully we meet again</p>
