<p>Commuting is a tough life, struggle! From the subways(RT), to the buses(BRT) and streetcars(LRT). The worst is the streetcars. Before I continue, I feel some background is required.I live in the greater area of Toronto, Canada and I work downtown like really downtown.</p>
<p>Back to streetcars. They can only roam about downtown. Good thing because they are <del>ridiculously</del> sometimes slow and extra packed during rush hour. I once saw a guy contort because he was trying to fit in and didn't want to wait for the next streetcar. It was funny to watch and I would say that brightened my day.</p>
<p>I use all method of commuting shy of biking to get to work everyday. There is always a delay or the vehicle going out of service. As a result <del>(my assumptions)</del> people always rush to enter the first one in sight. You never know when the next functioning one might come and nobody want to be late.</p>

<p>One last thing, I am trying to look for a picture of an artwork done on subway maps in four cities. I was going to include it in the post, that's why it wasn't up yesterday. If you know where I can find it please leave a link in the comment. Thanks :)</p>
<p>I'm excited for the <a title="One a Day" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/photography-challenge/">photo challenge</a> starting on Monday!!!</p>
