<blockquote><a title="Daily Prompt: Fantasy" href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/daily-prompt-fantasy/" target="_blank">The Tooth Fairy (or Easter Bunny, or Santa Claus . . .): a fun and harmless fiction, or a pointless justification for lying to children?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-231" alt="Lying or Not" src="http://alldayrandom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/when-you-are-accused-of-lying.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="206" /></p>
<p>I grew not knowing about Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy but I knew Santa Claus however I learnt about all through cartoons and fairy tales. My version of tooth fairy that I knew growing up was to throw the tooth on a high place so it grows back.</p>
<p>I am going to go Humpty Dumpty on this and say I agree with both and I have my justification for it.</p>
<p>It's a fun and harmless fiction because it helps kids deal with things that are seen as too old for them or might rub then of a fun childhood. Children should be well equipped with life but fantasies like this preserves their innocence much longer.</p>
<p>It is a pointless justification because it robs the actions of their essence: tooth fairy, the child focuses on money; easter bunny, chocolates; santa claus, gifts they wish for. Children need to be well equipped to deal with like and shielding them like this does no good.</p>
<p>Have I confused you? You're not alone</p>
<p>Would I perpetuate this to my kids? No but I wouldn't discourage it either</p>
<p>I love fairy tales and cartoons. Even though I know they are unreal or impossible and I point it out everytime.</p>
