<p>"Through a microscope one discovers that there are many kinds of snow: those made up of tiny painting of shipwrecks in the style of Bonaventura Peeters, those made up of miniature bowls of wax fruit, very beautifully and realiztically formed, except for the size; those made up of the clippings of babies; and those made up of the trimmed and tattooed scalps of shrews used as money by certain native peoples of the southern Urals.</p>

<p>Obviously there is snow made of the unread letters of unloved lovers and metal snow made of discs with serrated edges, to mention only one of the innumerable members of the great class of the snows of war for there is no end to forms of cruelty.</p>

<p>But there are innumerable kindly snow as well, such as those made of the golden crumbs of sleepy and dainty snows made of miniature ladies underpants, some with persimmon-colored ribbons woven through the lace, some embroidered with tiny green apples.</p>

<p>There are hungry snow made of ground teeth and sacrificial snows made of...</p>
<p>p.s. In case you didn't notice what I did, the complete title is: "Stories made in the coldest winter... to may of unloved snows "</p>
<p>What other sentences can you make from her words?</p>
