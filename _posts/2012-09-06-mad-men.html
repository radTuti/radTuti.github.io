<p>Today is just one of those days. I am really exhausted**, didn't get the time to start my photo <a title="One a Day" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/photography-challenge/">challenge</a>. I'm moving the start date of the challenge to Monday.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here's a picture* my friend shared with me today. Life sucks and rocks at the same time for me but today feels more sucky and I have to ask myself: "What is it for?"</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94" title="Life" src="http://alldayrandom.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/life.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="707" /></p>
<p>I am currently watching <a title="Mad Men (TV Series 2007) - IMDb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/">mad men</a> from the beginning.</p>
<p>*I do not know the source of the picture</p>
<p>**I apologize for the post and my present state</p>
