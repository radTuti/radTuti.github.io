<p>I have a thing for <a class="zem_slink" title="Sophie Kinsella" href="http://www.sophiekinsella.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Sophie Kinsella</a>. I love <em>all</em> her books (except the <a class="zem_slink" title="Shopaholic (novels)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopaholic_%28novels%29" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Shopaholic</a> series). My favorite lighthearted bookÂ is <a class="zem_slink" title="Twenties Girl: A Novel" href="http://www.amazon.com/Twenties-Girl-Novel-Sophie-Kinsella/dp/0385342020%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0385342020" target="_blank" rel="amazon">Twenties Girl</a>. I don't have an all time favorite book as I group it by categories. There are several covers for Twenties Girl.</p>
