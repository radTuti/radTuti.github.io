For the past couple of months, I have been working on a side project with a friend. I have really excited about this project although I am scared of the success. Regardless, I have remained passionate even on days when I feel like I am lagging behind.

Since I started working on it I have caught myself looking at different things which results in the most amazing inspirations. During those times, I really want to contact the _powers that be_ requesting collaborations, face times ect. Just as I pick up my phone and start composing a(n) email/message/tweet/_other form of communication_ I come to the realize that I am writing about a project that exisit in various parts/places of which the most complete lives in my mind.

It is a sad realization. It is soul crushing. It is encouraging. At that moment I realize that I have the powers to make the project complete outside my mind. I get it! I have the full picture. Eureka! It is now time to put in some work. Then a new sad realization comes: I need others to do the work.

In case you have not noticed I have now placed myself in a recursive loop.
	1. I cannott reach out to others until my idea is complete
	2. I cannot complete the project alone
	3. I need to reach out to other people to cmplete my idea
	
So it goes 1 -> 2 -> 3 ->1 ect.

This makes me wonder "how do you get someone excited about your idea when the idea in its most complete form format resides in your mind?"

I am confident that soon I'll figure it out.
