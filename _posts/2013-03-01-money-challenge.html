<p>So I read about how <a title="How this military family of four lives well on just $14,000 per year" href="http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/military-family-manages-scrape-14-001249660.html" target="_blank">a military family of four manages to live well off on $14000 a year</a> with no debt on <a class="zem_slink" title="Business Insider" href="http://www.businessinsider.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Business Insider</a>. I was talking about this with a friend of mine, DJ and we decided to take it as a money challenge. One thing I picked up from the article was they had a $400 budget for grocery shopping.</p>
<p>I would call myself a privileged child. I'm graduating university in a few months and I don't have any <a class="zem_slink" title="Student loan payments" href="http://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/discharging-student-loans.html" target="_blank" rel="lawlibrary">student loan</a> because of my parents. I still get my rent paid and a stipend from my parents even though I'm working (part-time). I spend very little from my paycheck and have a credit card debt I can easily pay off with some of my savings.  So why am I embarking on this? Let's say I have big plans.</p>
<p>I'm planing on moving to a new place which might end up costing about 50% more than where I currently am. I want to be partly independent from my parents (baby steps) so I've set a $400/ month budget for myself. The $400/ month should cover all my monthly expenses  including my ~$100 phone bill and ~$110 bus pass which leave a little under $200 for groceries and other expenses (excluding tithe).</p>
<p>Since its a new month today, the challenge start today and hopefully most of it. A few details to drop now that might set me up for failure: I am planing on buying a <a title="Sony | NEX 6" href="http://store.sony.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=20153&amp;langId=200&amp;catalogId=100803&amp;identifier=S_NEX6" target="_blank">NEX 6 camera</a> today, I might be going out with friends tonight, I don't buy groceries and eat out a lot.</p>
<p>All I can think of is Mission Impossible :(</p>
