<blockquote><a title="Daily Prompt: All Grown Up" href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/daily-prompt-grown/" target="_blank"><strong>When was the first time you really felt like a grown up (if ever)?</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>I am going to be 13 years old in December. My parents are taking me to my new school this afternoon. It is a boarding school and I am so excited about it.</p>
<p>Ever since I found out I got accepted in the school; which not to be proud but I am pretty smart and I was sure I would get in. I hate that I am leaving my old school for this one, I wanted to go to my elder sister's boarding school which looks way better.</p>
<p>For the past few months I've dream about life in boarding school, though about relieving my sister's boarding school stories. In my dream, boarding school is so glorious <del>and it would be like the movies I've watched. Better yet, it would feel like a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie; they are my favorite</del>.</p>
<p>"...Tuti, you are a big girl now...we would try to come visit you in a month..."</p>
<p><em>Fast-forward...</em></p>
<p>As I settle in new bunk bed that night (that my mum made), I review my first half-day at boarding school. <em>My parents aren't here</em>...I try not to cry as I go to sleep.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>I am starting Grade 10 tomorrow. I am in new school. I would not see my parents for a while. Daddy's little girl is becoming an adult :)</p>
<hr />
<p>Going to boarding school was my first step towards independence. I was finally growing up. While the tone of this story is all rosy,  I failed for the first time in my life that semester so my parents would withdraw me from the school <em>(I disliked the school</em>). Three years after, I finished at the school (<em>it was a love-hate relationship then</em>). Some years later <em>(today</em>) this note was typed.</p>
