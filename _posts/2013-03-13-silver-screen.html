<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Tommy</strong>: It's OK, you don't get it. It's no big deal. But you will. One day you'll meet someone and it'll literally take your breath away. Like you can't breathe. Like no oxygen to the lungs. Like a fish...</p>

<p>"In case you don't know this I'm scared of commitments..."</p>
<p>"I know you have you demons to work on but I care about this, you and I, us"</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">----------</p>
<p>"Wait...this is what I want to do...I'm changing my plan but  I don't want to extend my plan for that number"</p>
<p>[<em>time lapses</em>]</p>
<p>"Shit! Are you trying to tell me I can only upgrade every three years except I pay off my contract?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">----------</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"I have been doing a lot of thinking and I think this, we, you and I, is not going to work"</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">----------</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"I'm stuck with this for better or for worse for the next three years so I have to suck it up and love it"</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Noah</strong>: So it's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be really hard. We're gonna have to work at this every day, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, for ever, you and me, every day. Will you do something for me, please? Just picture your life for me? 30 years from now, 40 years from now? What's it look like? If it's with him, go. Go! I lost you once, I think I can do it again. If I thought that's what you really wanted. But don't you take the easy way out.

<p>I love The Notebook, cried every time I watched it and I've watched it a lot. The pain, the hurt, the love...I think it was a better love story than Titanic</p>
<p>Friends With Benefits was so much fun. In case you haven't notice on this blog, I have a somewhat unhealthy love for Justin Timberlake. The Hollywood sign part of the movie was pure jokes!</p>
<p>Anyone ever signed up for a phone contract know how annoying it is. In canada I feel it's worse because we have this stupid thing called "Local calling area" . The other portion to this post was when I was trying to get my iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Finally I struggle with relationships. I have commitments and trust issues plus I get bored easily and tend to get distant. Relationships involve trust one another and waking up everyday knowing that same person would light up your day no matter how annoying they are.</p>
