<p>Sometimes people mistake their wants for needs. A lot of times when people say they need something, what it really means is they want something.</p>
<p>With the constant postulation that humans have evolved into wiser and better creatures, one thing that has been overlook is their inability to sometimes distinguish their wants for needs.</p>
<p>This is my reason as to why most people assume the American dream doesn't exist. A lot of people relocate to America with the hopes of living a dream and after years are frustrated by their inability to achieve this dream. This is because the real American dream is based on having their needs fulfilled while they are chasing one filled with a life time of want.</p>
<p>At this point, I will like to point out that there is nothing wrong with having wants. It is my belief that we are designed to have a wants and needs system. Wants &amp; Needs Â gives people hope and faith that they can achieve everything. However when they have attained their optimal level of needs they are blinded by their long list of wants and begin to despair.</p>
<p>At the establishment of the American dream, America was a different place from what it is now. While people have adapted to the current state of America, they still seem to cling onto the American dream established in the past refusing to adapt it to present times.</p>
