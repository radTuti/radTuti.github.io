<p>I would send a message to myself and my future kids. Here's what I will say:</p>
<p>Dear Future Tuti,</p>
<p>Don't get freaked out but this is you from 2013.  I hope you are alive and things are going well. Did we get married? Have kids? No don't tell me. If we had kids, tell them I'm sorry I didn't want them at some point but if it makes them feel better, I had their names picked out if I ever had them (which I did if you are apologizing).</p>
<p>I lied I want to know but don't tell me obvious details. What changed our mind about marriage and kids? Again if we didn't, why am I so transfixed about this? Well I'm scared as hell and I don't want to mess up your life. So do whatever you've always wanted to do and screw the rest of the world!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>2013 Tuti</p>
<p>P.S. Our <a title="Money Challenge" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2013/03/01/money-challenge/" target="_blank">monetary challenge</a> paid off right? Are we better at photography now?</p>
<p>P.P.S. The suspense of recieving a reply is killing me so I think I better not send it</p>
