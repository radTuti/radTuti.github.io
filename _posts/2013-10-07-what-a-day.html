<p>I guess this might be considered an appreciation post although it's less likely that the addressed subjected might read it.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a somewhat tedious day; it was one of my love's birthday and she was having a soiree in the evening to celebrate. My day was actually quite busy; I had a photography workshop to go to then a meeting for Chase Toronto and then my friend's party...<em>did I mention all events were somewhat back to back</em>.</p>
<p>I couldn't go for the workshop because I had to help my friend with her party and then I didn't go for the meeting because - truth be told - I did not remember about it :( there was too much going on. I really feel awful about missing those 2 events as I was pretty excited for it. I think of the most out-of-the-box way to make things up when I feel awful...<em>F. Y. I. they are not logically possible</em>.</p>
<p>Since my friend's party was happening close to so my place, my apartment was the base for all preparation which ended up with it looking like a mess. The party was good; we played a weird version of charade but the point was my team won. I know those games are meant to just be for fun but it's so hard to resist competing; I wasn't raised like that.</p>
<p>After the birthday shenanigans, I had to drop a few people off at the station so they can get home. On my way back, I'm thinking about the stress of clearing things up and all that extra jazz. I open my apartment door and it clean; the dishwasher is running, the floors have been wiped and everywhere was looking extra proper. I guess the point of this is...<em>life doesn't always go as you plan so get a boyfriend!</em> And just incase you don't want one...</p>

<p>I'll like to point out that there's a variety of breed to the species called "<em>boyfriend</em>" so be careful when you pick one. I made a choice and I'm still taking it one step at a time.</p>
