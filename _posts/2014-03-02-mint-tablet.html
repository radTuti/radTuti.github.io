<p>I was going to bed last night and I decided I just had to blog about money management because I was proud on how much restraint I showed.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, my bf was telling me to get a tablet because I have a unhealthy habit of ordering books from <a title="Canada's Online Book Store: New &amp; Used Books &amp; Much More" href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/" target="_blank">Chapters Indigo</a>. To expand on that due to their new mobile app, free delivery for orders over $25 and I get great deals not buying in store; I always order a lot more books that I've finished reading.</p>
<p>As I pondered on getting a tablet, I posed a question on Facebook about making a choice between an iPad mini, a Nexus 7 or a Kobo. While I was leaning towards an iPad mini because I have an Apple ecosystem, I was curious about getting an Android device - it would be my first - and my mother loved her Kobo tablet. I decided to get a tablet only when I had the money - saved up - for it.</p>

<p>I had joined <a title="Mint - Personal Finance, Budgetung, Money Management..." href="https://www.mint.com" target="_blank">Mint.com</a> a couple of months back but didn't stick with it as sticking to a budget was never my thing. Recently I realized as I get older, I need to get more serious with what I spend money on which maybe a result of all the bills and responsibilities I now have leaving school and working.</p>
<p>Some days ago, I found an ad for a Nexus 7 and I contemplated putting in an offer, the longer it stayed up the more resolved I was to make an offer. I offered less than the asking price because I was dipping into my savings for something else. He got an offer above his asking price and turned me down. I was a little down and considered topping the offer to almost double my initial offer (<em>more dent in my budget</em>) but decided against after seeking advice.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning and got paranoid about missing my alarm - as always - I checked my phone and I saw that my initial offer for the Nexus was accepted. I was off my bed and united with my Nexus 7 within twenty minutes. I call her Zora.</p>
