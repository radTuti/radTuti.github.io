<p>This weekend was meant to be a relaxing long weekend. He had told his buddies he'll be going home to see his family. He told his family he had a weekend with the boys. He just wanted one weekend with the 100 Jazz Essentials album on repeat while playing video games drinking beer and eating. Obviously he would go to the gym for 1/2 hour at 6AM and 11PM but that was the only routine he planned to keep.</p>
<p>That was the plan. That wasn't what happened.</p>
<p>All weekend he had to deal with loud voices and the crying of a kid from his neighbour. Times like this makes his hate wooden walls and living in a condo instead of a house. Last time he checked his neighbour wasn't married and yes she has guys/ friends coming over occasionally but they weren't noisy. One time, he heard noises from her apartment that made me think about her in a more attractive way.</p>
<p>That's it! The kid has been crying for almost an hour and he's done bearing it plus this gives him an excuse to talk to her.</p>
<p>*<em>knock</em>* *<em>knock</em>*</p>
<p>Once she heard it, she knew it was a neighbour coming to complain. Her nephew has been crying because she was denying his something. Looking through the peephole, she noticed it was the cute guy that lived opposite her.</p>
<p>"Oh! *bleep* me."</p>
<p>This was not how she imagined their first conversation. She went to the washroom to make sure she looked already before she opened the door.</p>

<p>Her: Hi!</p>
<p>Him: Hi! Uhm...do you have a kid in there or is your TV turned up really loud?</p>
<p>Her: Oh! I'm so sorry. That's my nephew, I'm trying to wean him off his pacifier and the battle is not going in my favor.</p>
<p>She said that with a small laugh that turned to a smile. She has an amazing smile. He had been staring at her looking uninterested with what she was saying. She started to feel bad that she made him angry so she tried to think up something else.</p>
<p>Her: You know what? I'll let him win and I can make it up to you. Coffee, lunch or dinner, my treat?</p>
<p>She smiled again. He was barely listening to her but the last part of her statement caught his attention.</p>
<p>Him: You don't need to make it up. Sorry I came over.</p>
<p>As he proceeded to leave, she said something which made him stop and turn.</p>
<p>Him: Alright! I need to have dinner tonight anyways so Marben. 8pm?</p>
<p>Her: I can't tonight but how about I let you know when I'm free and we'll coordinate. I'm Rue.</p>
<p>Him: Brad. Okay. I stay at 1007 so let me know when. Bye</p>
<p>He went to his apartment while she stood by the door watching him.</p>
