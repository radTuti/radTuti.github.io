<span style="margin:0;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/93120024@N07/8576982185/">Insight</a>, a photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/93120024@N07/">Tuti A'mare</a> on <a class="zem_slink" title="Flickr" href="http://flickr.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Flickr</a>.</span></div>
<p>After pondering about it for so long, I decided to get a camera. I got the NEX-6 with 16-55mm lens from <a class="zem_slink" title="Sony" href="http://www.sony.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Sony</a>. I call her <a class="zem_slink" title="Athena" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Athena</a>. I have been doing a couple of test shots with everything. My very patient subject is Pops who has been with me since 2008.<br />
I like this shot very much because Pops has so much character in here. I call this shot "Insight"</p>
<p>That said, let's say the <a title="One aÂ Day" href="http://alldayrandom.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/photography-challenge/">photography challenge</a> is finally back on. I created a <a title="Flickr: Tuti's Photostream" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/93120024@N07/" target="_blank">Flickr account</a> to upload picture but I'll try to post at least once a day here.</p>
