<p>I find myself struggling everyday about life and this has gotten worse in the past few days/weeks...</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a trend but whenever something <del>new [read:</del>good<del>]</del> happens in my life,  I question it thinking I'm not worthy of it. Am I the only one that gets embarrassed when complimented? I always seem to find a way to put myself down right after. Or I think the compliments are insincere.</p>
<p>Nobody believes I'm shy and sometimes I cannot tell if this is because of self esteem because I do have a huge ego. I can get outspoken and I have this facade that I show to everyone but nobody sees the real me. I am that girl that lays on her bed and think about when last she's cried. If it has been too long, I find a reason to cry or sometimes I just cry because I feel I ought to.</p>
<p>I have read somewhere that the name a parent gives a child has an impacts on the child's life. I was named after one of the many <del>unfortunate</del> persons from the bible, Ruth. I've read the Book of Ruth several times and I still can't find how the name relates except she wasn't dealt a good hand by life. Does this mean I am doomed to be sad? My mother was going to name me Elizabeth; would that have made my life better? Can I change my name like Jacob to Isreal?</p>
<p>I try to live a life with little care in the world but am I really depressed within? I feel ungrateful typing this post because life has been great recently: I have a <del>new</del> job, new place and redefined friendships. Yet I ask myself, what's the catch? I keep waiting for the ball to drop. This may trace back to when I became a teenager and my perspective of life, love and family changed. I though I forgave all that...why can't I forget? how to I forget? when would I forget? will I ever forget?</p>
<p>I used to think about suicide when I was in high school. I got interested in biology because I wanted to know how the body works and the fasted way to get it offline. I loved chemistry mainly to learn the right composition to make lethal chemicals. I hate biology now and I don't learn about chemicals anymore. I now think it is selfish of me to end my life without living it. I want to live a fulfilled life where I get to enjoy the finer things of life without questioning it. Is that ever going to happen?</p>
<p>I grew up religious (Christian) but along the way I lost my faith in God and started questioning everything I knew from my childhood. In the past five years, I have tried several times to find my way back but how do I find my way when I don't know <del>or trust</del> where I'm heading? I have a kindled fire that I neglect till it starts to turn to ash and when there's just the right mix to kill the fire, I soothe it till its a raging fire again. I am sure if I want to stop this cycle but it makes me unable to connect to Him or anyone on a deeper level.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is a cry for help but I could use a cry right now...</p>
