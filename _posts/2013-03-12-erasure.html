<blockquote><a title="Daily Prompt: Erasure | The Daily Post" href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/daily-prompt-erasure/" target="_blank"><strong>You have the choice to erase one incident from your past, as though it never happened. What would you erase and why?</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>"<em>I know you like it so why would you not take it</em>"</p>
<p>"I made a promise and I am going to regret this"</p>
<p>"<em>What promise?</em>" *<em>laughs</em>*</p>
<p>"It was mainly for myself, that's what they said by I did it for them"</p>
<p>"<em>Well I guess you should not do it then...</em>"</p>
<p>That look said it all... I was going to hurt someone regardless of my decision...why did I have to make the promise? why couldn't I have just been trusted to stick with my guts?</p>
<p>Well if they think I will slide then there's no point keeping the promise...</p>
<p>"No..." I say "I can do this"</p>
<p>I looked at the candy and then tasted it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:left;">I cannot erase any part of me but if I could; the moment I give in easily to what was right in front of me because I think it would spite someone. I use candy above because at those moments it feels like taking candy, so irresistible but I regret it :(</p>
