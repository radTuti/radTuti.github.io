<p>Today I finally got the courage and told him.</p>
<p>"...I've cheated on you"</p>
<p>For the few seconds it took him to say something, I went to hell and back several times. I was trying to come up with a backup strategy; I'll tell him I was joking and was trying to elicit a response from him. <em>Why did I not think this through? I don't want this relationship to end. I care for him too much to let him go</em>.</p>
<p>He said "What did you do?"</p>
<p>I had no intentions of telling him the truth. I do not think he would like hearing me talk about how I went to the other guy's place before I came to his place. He wouldn't want to hear that the night I was moody and he though he did something wrong and kept trying to make it up to me was the night I cheated on him.</p>
<p>"It was a few weeks ago, sketchy on the date but we were not in a good place then... it meant nothing"</p>
<p>That wasn't entirely a lie; more like a white lie since I only omitted a few things. We really weren't in a good place as we were in a cycle of arguing and making up. I really don't remember the date but I remember everything that happened that day and it was like 3/4 weeks ago...</p>
<p>He just said something. "That's okay. I forgive you just don't do it again".</p>
<p>I got up from where  I was, gave him a kiss and smiled.</p>
<p>"I'll make it up to you. I'm sorry"</p>
<p>We went back to watching the movie but I am no longer interested in watching it but I do smiling and laughing when appropirate.</p>
<p><i>Where do we go from here?</i></p>
