<pre>Disclaimer: This is a <a class="zem_slink" title="Satire" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">satiric</a> account and while this is based on a true life event, most of the statements included are for dramatization; hence they are false of the writer's imagination.</pre>
<p>Nobody ever thought the day would come and when it did, there was doom across the land...oops I mean office. What is this great evil that has befallen us? Our <a class="zem_slink" title="Keurig" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keurig" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Keurig</a> broke!!!</p>
<p><em>*insert dramatic sounds in movies*</em></p>
<p>As a resident, I have taken it upon myself to try to explain the history and hopefully the causation of the Keurig bugs.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="266"]<a title="The KEURIG'r Box by Dan Pancamo, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pancamo/4190980259/"><img alt="The KEURIG'r Box" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2558/4190980259_d7611eb223.jpg" width="266" height="400" /></a> The KEURIG'r Box by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pancamo/" target="_blank">Dan Pancamo</a>[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;">Many months ago, a discovery was made: We love coffee and tea in the office and would do McDonalds runs at least twice a day not including lunch. To combat it the King with the advice of his aides decided it was time to call upon the Coffee Brewers to aid in this process. Keurig was chosen and to offset the cost to the </span><del>office</del><a id="yui_3_7_3_3_1373910847438_1216" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pancamo/"></a><del>land</del><span style="color:#333333;"> office, people were going to be levied a token.</span></p>
<p>This brought joy into the land (<i>hell! you know I mean office</i>) and the only unhappy party in this deal was McDonalds. You see, the coffee runs also coincided with breakfast and most days may influence lunch. This would decrease the revenue from this land to this giant.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--><br />
Many months passed and the people of the land still rejoiced. The introduction of Keurig reduced the money out of the people's pockets. Alas it was not all rosy, people developed a habit of abandoning <a class="zem_slink" title="K-Cup" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Cup" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">K-cups</a> in Keurig and ignoring to refill the water level when they were done. A resident took it upon his/her-self to establish the Keurig Brewing Rules (K.B.R.)</p>
<p>This reduced the problems a little bit and once again, for the most part, the land was in coffee-tea heaven. One day a resident went to pray to Keurig but there was no response. Some procedures were taken but the Keurig gods had turned deaf ears. The land was aghast! A plan was suggested to <del>steal from</del> swap with the other town in the land but the folly dismissed  as their gods are different.</p>
<address style="padding-left:30px;"><em>I work in software development and the next few lines make reference to its terms</em></address>
<p>A few residents decided that Keurig had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_(computers)#Issue" target="_blank">bugs</a> (<em>it is possible that there</em><i> were actual tiny bugs in it</i>); a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system" target="_blank">ticket</a> should be made and assigned to the King's aide in charge. An email was sent with an out-of-order planned to be erected outside. The strange thing about the gods were they ignored when given offering (K-cup) and sometimes would answers w/o offerings. Were the gods becoming selfless? No!</p>
<p>Just the other hour a resident was almost mad due to lack of coffee fix from the Keurig gods. The resident was rushed to the sanatorium called Starbucks  it was a True North* intervention according to the resident, I am that resident. The gods have left unhappy people with chances of running berserk without their regular fix. Is the Kingdom in danger? Only time will tell.</p>
<pre>*True North is blonde roast in Canada.</pre>
