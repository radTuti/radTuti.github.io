<p>If you were to look under my bed, there is a under-bed storage filled with bags, most of which I do not want anymore because they are not perfect. If you know what I carry in my bag, you will understand why I need a perfect bag. Now I understand that perfection is hard to achieve so let's modify that term, how about ultimate? I desire the ultimate bag.</p>
<p>On any given day, when I am heading out, here's what I like to have in my bag:  notebook; book I'm currently reading; iPhone, earpods &amp; charger; NEX-6 camera &amp; charger; handkerchief; portable shopping bag; 2 sunglasses (one for biking and a regular one); hairbrush; hand cream; lip balm &amp; lipstick; gum; pens, pencils &amp; eraser; USB stick; portable key chain toolbox; sennheisers headphones; apartment keys; wallet. Wow! that's quiet a list! To think I fit that into a <a title="Tuti| The Burning House" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/93120024@N07/9517281724/">small across shoulder bag shown here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, there are sometimes when I have to take my laptop along with me somewhere, this is where the dilemma strikes; my current bag is too stuffed up to fit my 13" MacBook + charger!  I don't like to have to change my bag if I am going someplace fancy or someplace I'll look odd with a backpack plus I spend most time bicycling or taking transit everywhere. Hence, I need a <del>stylish</del> bag that will suit all outfits and occasions.</p>
<p>Trying not to put a strain on my finances, I've looked into <a title="Key-Per Flap" href="http://www.fossil.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=12052&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=25005&amp;categoryId=331141&amp;productId=22442968&amp;imagePath=ZB5602993">Fossil Key-Per Flap</a>, <a href="http://shop.herschelsupply.ca/collections/messenger-bags/products/mill-messenger-navy-red">Hershel Supply Co Mill Messenger</a> and I give up! Nothing can be within my budget, take up all I carry daily and my laptop occasionally :( I need help! I've considered getting an iPad mini to take on the go in-place of my laptop but I must admit that it cannot do a lot of the tasks I require of my laptop. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>When I started this post; I was just going to talk about bags I've been looking at lately and now it's turned into a lamentation; why I need an ultimate bag soon!</p>
