<p>NYSC is short for National Youth Service Corps. It is an organization setup in late 1972 to reduce unemployment while promoting inter-ethnic unity across the country and getting youths involved in the development of the country. The corpers (standard name for those in their service year) have to undertake a one year mandatory service outside their state of origin and will be given monthly allowance (smaller than expected earnings).Upon the completion of their service year, corpers are given a certificate that allows them to gain employment in Nigeria.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/93120024@N07/9447330163/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7270/7599551872_57a5246587_b.jpg" width="560" height="372" /></a></p>
<p>My sister did her service year in Abia and she told me the first day she got there she cried because there were no beds available so she slept on a plank. I hardly saw her during that year because of the long journey it would take for her to come back. She had very bad experiences and she also had great ones; she even learnt some Ibo. Now she talks about a few people she wouldn't have met if it weren't for NYSC.</p>
<p>Call me a patriot or a hypocrite but I want to serve my country for one year. I want to experience other cultures and learn a new language (Hausa to be precise). I've dreamt of doing my service year in Plateau(Jos) or some northern state for the longest time. With the knowledge that picking a state isn't up to the corper - although some people chose to 'work it out' - for the longest time, I've prayed for Plateau.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>I learnt something that changed me; youths who schooled outside the country could pick which state to serve. Imagine my delight once I knew that and I was having my post secondary education outside Nigeria (Canada); I could pick Plateau for my service year. I was dissapointed when I found out that I could pick between Lagos or Abuja only.</p>
<p>Reading through a scholarly paper written in 1990 and observing the current state of NYSC, it is no news that the NYSC system has suffered greatly from mismanagement, insufficient resources and corruption - as with a lot of sectors in Nigeria. A lot of people do not view NYSC the way I do; maybe because of the ever-present cultural/religious clashes or/ and the fact that the allowance give is too minimal in sustaining a standard of living.</p>
<p>Last year, I was talking to someone about the NYSC program - in Canada - and they responded that were something like that utilized here (Canada), it could reduce the level of unemployment among new graduates by exposing them to new opportunities while ensuring that rural areas area have the people and skills they require. I understand that Canada is a lot different from Nigeria.</p>

<p>Here's is my case, rather than scrap the program or make it optional, the program need to be revised to fulfil the goals it was created for. While I know that talk is cheap, it is helpful if we had more people believe and try to implement the change. We the youths of Nigeria (in country and diaspora) need to act as agent of change, have faith and work toward achieve a new standard for the country.</p>
<p>Now I leave with one running joke: When we were kids with Babaginda and Obasanjo in government we are told we are the leaders of tomorrow; tomorrow has come and we are grown up yet Babaginda and Obasanjo are still in the government, when we are tomorrow. I say we need to seize the day and become the leaders we hope to be.</p>
