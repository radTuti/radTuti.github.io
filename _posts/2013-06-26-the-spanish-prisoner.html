<p>I recently read 419 by William Ferguson which is about the Nigerian Scam popularly called 419*. A friend asked me to do a review when I tweeted a picture of my new purchases (which included the book 419).</p>
<p>I was elated by the accurate portrayal of the Nigerian Airport and how the Nigerian weather might feel to someone coming from Canada. In the beginning, I somewhat forced myself to keep reading. While I recognized that Laura was the protagonist, I was mostly interested in Nnamdi's story which hurt me what he went through in the end.</p>
<p>I cannot for the life of me place why Amina was in the story as there wasn't much background, all I figured was she once has a better heritage but now she has to keep heading south though her people were from the North (presumably outside Nigeria and associated with Hausas). I do not know if this was deliberate but I appreciate the author's attempt to capture the three "<em>major</em>"Â parts of Nigeria (Hausa, Igbo &amp; Yoruba) as Kaduna, Niger Delta &amp; Lagos - <em>now we can digress and get critical about how people from Niger Delta aren't Igbo</em>.</p>

<p>Ignorant as I am still - I am vaguely aware of the history of Niger Delta - I was impressed by the history given to Nnamdi. While I admit that a few other things didn't make sense or felt irrelevant, I'll have to say it was a good read. Readers are able to sympathize with the major characters - albeit to vary degrees - and their situation. One thing I'll like further explanation is how Laura defied the odds and what she did in the end.</p>
<p>I cannot rate the book on a scale and my review is mostly bland because I was reading it concurrently with Quiet: The Power of Introverts by Susan Cain which I took a hiatus from to read Z: A novel of Zelda Fitzgerald by Therese Anne Fowler.</p>
<p>After finishing Z, I've the need to read all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short stories. In addition, due to my fascination with the Twenties I want to read The Great Gatsby - I've never read it - especially since I'm finally planning the party I should have had for my last birthday for the upcoming birthday.</p>
<p>* 419 is a Nigerian adaptation of the Spanish Prisoner scam with the use of modern communication technologies.</p>
<p>P.S. I got a 419-like email a few days before reading the book. I know! Weird coincidence.</p>
