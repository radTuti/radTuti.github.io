In some other parts of the world, I go by [**Tofunmi**](http://about.me/tofunmi).

I work as a Software Developer. Some languages I know/am learning: Java, PHP, CSS, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Python.

I graduated from [York University](http://www.yorku.ca) with BHS Health Studies with Specialized Honors in Health Informatics. It's a mouthful!

My favorite color is Grey.

Contary to popular beliefs, I go by Tuti not to shorten Tofunmi but because it is a Hebrew variant of my Christain name, Ruth.

I love reading and I'm avid for photography.
